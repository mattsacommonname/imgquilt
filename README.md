# imgquilt

Stitches images together into a bigger image.

## Background

I needed a tool to tile irregularly sized images. Then I kept fiddling with the tool, and here we are.

## What's with the name?

Yes, I know I normally name projects things like **pretentious-raptor** or **underwater-basket**. But, since I'm going to be actually typing this on the command line, I gave it a short, sensible name. Sorry.
